# FLIGHT-FOUNDER-WITHOUT-OOP
It is a code that i will use to create flight_founder with OOP. They basically will do the same. The main goal of this code is
finding a flight with the parameters that we created at first. It finds flight compares it to a minumum price that we have already setted 
in some google sheet document. And if it is cheaper than this flight. It sends an sms to my number.
